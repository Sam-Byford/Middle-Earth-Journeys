## Overview
Middle Earth Journeys is an exercise companion app that aims to encourage users to get out and partake in physical activity. It provides a more engaging way for less motivated individuals to get fit than conventional running apps by allowing users to follow in the footsteps of J. R. R. Tolkien’s Middle Earth heroes. Users can select from two different quest options and explore the land of Middle Earth whilst walking, running, or cycling. 

The application tracks user movement giving performance metrics such as distance covered, average pace and time spent. Then, depending on the difficulty the user selected, it calculates how far through the quest and whereabouts in Middle Earth they are. The quests are long and therefore are designed to be tackled in ‘sections’, each time the user resumes a quest, a section is created. When they pause the quest the section results (distance covered, time etc) are added to the total quest statistics. If they have travelled the required distance in middle earth, they will discover one of a plethora of landmarks. These landmarks are accompanied by videos, images and descriptive text which informs users about the location.
